# Deno Terraform Provider

This provider uses the Deno API to manage Deno projects, custom domains, and
deployments. A simple example is available in examples/. This is a very early
release of the provider. Additional documentation and examples are forthcoming.

There are working examples in `/examples`. To use the examples, you need
a Deno deploy organization ID and an access token. See `docs/index.md` for
instructions on finding or creating those values.

Resource and schema documentation still needs to be written. In the interim,
API documentation is available at https://deno-deploy-v1.redoc.ly/. Resources
are strongly aligned to the API.
