# deno_deployment (Resource)

A resource for a Deno Deploy deployment.

A deployment belongs to a project, is an immutable, invokable snapshot of the project's assets, can be assigned a custom domain.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Assuming the following directory structure (fresh project):

# ├── fresh.gen.ts
# ├── islands
# │   └── Counter.tsx

resource "deno_project" "my_project" {}

data "deno_assets" "my_assets" {
  glob = "../**/*.{ts,tsx,json,ico,svg,css}"
}

resource "deno_deployment" "example1" {
  # Project ID that the created deployment belongs to.
  project_id = deno_project.myproject.id
  # File path for the deployments' entry point.
  entry_point_url = "../main.ts"
  compiler_options = {
    jsx               = "react-jsx"
    jsx_import_source = "preact"
  }
  assets = data.deno_assets.my_assets.output
  env_vars = {
    FOO = "42"

## Schema

### Required

- `assets` (Attributes Map) The entities that compose the deployment. A key represents a path to the entity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--assets))
- `entry_point_url` (String) The path to the file that will be executed when the deployment is invoked.
- `env_vars` (Map of String) The environment variables to be set in the runtime environment of the deployment.
- `project_id` (String) The project ID that this deployment belongs to.

### Optional

- `compiler_options` (Attributes) Compiler options to be used when building the deployment. If this is omitted and a deno config file (`deno.json` or `deno.jsonc`) is found in the assets, the value in the config file will be used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compiler_options))
- `import_map_url` (String) The path to the import map file. If this is omitted and a deno config file (`deno.json` or `deno.jsonc`) is found in the assets, the value in the config file will be used.
- `lock_file_url` (String) The path to the lock file. If this is omitted and a deno config file (`deno.json` or `deno.jsonc`) is found in the assets, the value in the config will be used.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The time the deployment was created, formmatting in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339).
- `deployment_id` (String) The ID of the deployment.
- `domains` (Set of String) The domain(s) that can be used to access the deployment.
- `status` (String) The status of the deployment, indicating whether the deployment succeeded or not. It can be "failed", "pending", or "success"
- `updated_at` (String) The time the deployment was last updated, formmatting in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339).
- `uploaded_assets` (Attributes Map) The assets that have been uploaded in previous deployments, keyed with hash of the content. This is inteneded to be used to avoid uploading the same assets multiple times. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--uploaded_assets))
